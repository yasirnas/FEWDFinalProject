    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>At WeCycle, weâ€™re committed to keeping the environment clean.  We offer a quick and easy way for New York residents to redeem their bottles and cans for cash. If you are tired of waiting on long lines to process your returns or fed up with full or broken redemption machines then WE CAN HELP.  We offer clients the ability to schedule a time for us to pick up their cans and bottles and an easy payment method to be compensated for the redemption payout..
