            At WeCycle, we’re committed to keeping the environment clean. We offer a quick and easy way for New York
            residents to redeem their bottles and cans for cash. If you are tired of waiting on long lines to
            process your returns or fed up with full or broken redemption machines then WE CAN HELP. We offer
            clients the ability to schedule a time for us to pick up their cans and bottles and an easy payment
            method to be compensated for the redemption payout. We are proudly serving West Islip and the
            immediately surrounding communities at this time. As our workforce grows we will be able to offer this
            service to a larger area.

        <p>
            1. SIGN UP with WeCycle. It's quick and easy!

            ​<br>

            2. Schedule an at-home pick up of your NY 5c redeemable aluminum cans, plastic bottles, and glass bottles
            (minimum amount required based on location). Miscellaneous recyclables can be picked up as an ADD ON
            service.

            ​<br>

            3. Leave the items to be picked up in front of your house by 8:00AM on your scheduled pick up day.

            ​<br>

            4. WeCycle will make the pick up and give you an instant payout with Venmo, Chase QuickPay with Zelle, and
            PayPal.
